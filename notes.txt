Personal notes while i'm working on this thesis.
This will kinda contain some on the fly notes to get me started quickly.

I will be doing a research to see how facial recognition can be applied on manga, for future deepfake/manga generation. 


- Can one facial recognition model work on all manga?
    - I would like to test on a couple of different manga 
        - One piece 
            - Heavy fantasy, very unique and 'quirky' drawing style
            - Has sharks etc... with faces.
        - Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso 
            - More realistic looking drawing style. 
        - Horimiya
            - Hyper realistic. Practically real.

- What are the different possibilities for facial detection on manga?
    - The AnimeFaceXML
        - Works okay on Horimiya, but less so on Shigatsu Wa Kimi and One Piece...
            - In One Piece it only detects the face of Nami, a female character.
            - Usually only detects frontal faces.
    - CNN
        - First day, pretty terrible results.
        - For the future    
            - ✓ Have dataset include captions, like english text
                - ✓ A lot of text gets mistaken for being a face.
                - ✓ Maybe create a second class for only text.
                    - ✓ Have to use a softmax layer then.
                        - Big improvement on accuracy. (20-30% gained.)
                        - Test this on same dataset that i used for AnimeFaceXML

                - ✓ Try Region of interest instead of sliding window.
                    - Much better results than Sliding window. Though can still be improved!
            - ✓ Have dataset include everything BUT faces. 
            - ✓ Make dataset images bigger. 
                - ✓ Try this with random.
    - Some pre trained networks (Resnet/VGG/Yolo etc...)
        - Using transfer learning.
    - HOG
    - Deformable Parts model.
    - ACFD: Asymmetric Cartoon Face Detector


- How do the different ways of detecting faces compare?
    - Make a visual way, like a graph to represent this.
- Is there a difference between detecting a realistic- or a fantasy oriented face?
- Is there a difference in model performance between the different manga genres or authors.
