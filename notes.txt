Personal notes while i'm working on this thesis.
This will kinda contain some on the fly notes to get me started quickly.

I will be doing a research to see how facial recognition can be applied on manga, for future deepfake/manga generation. 


- Can one facial recognition model work on all manga?
    - I would like to test on a couple of different manga 
        - One piece 
            - Heavy fantasy, very unique and 'quirky' drawing style
            - Has sharks etc... with faces.
        - Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso 
            - More realistic looking drawing style. 
        - Horimiya
            - Hyper realistic. Practically real.

- What are the different possibilities for facial detection on manga?
    - The AnimeFaceXML
        - Works okay on Horimiya, but less so on Shigatsu Wa Kimi and One Piece...
            - In One Piece it only detects the face of Nami, a female character.
            - Usually only detects frontal faces.
    - CNN
        - First day, pretty terrible results.
        - For the future    
            - ✓ Have dataset include captions, like english text
                - ✓ A lot of text gets mistaken for being a face.
                - ✓ Maybe create a second class for only text.
                    - ✓ Have to use a softmax layer then.
                        - Big improvement on accuracy. (20-30% gained.)
                        - Test this on same dataset that i used for AnimeFaceXML
                            - Not the best results but it does detect some faces.

                - ✓ Try Region of interest instead of sliding window.
                    - Much better results than Sliding window. Though can still be improved!
                    - ROI can also be improved, maybe Sliding window is better when using a deeper model.
            - ✓ Have dataset include everything BUT faces. 
            - ✓ Make dataset images bigger. 
                - ✓ Try this with random.
        
    - Faster R-CNN / YOLO 
        - CHANGE CHANNEL COUNT FROM 3 TO 2 IN NEXT NETWORK
        - Overlap. When two frames cover eachother for a certain percentage, throw one away.
        - Took about 8 hours to train.
            - First YOLO model results are amazing on realistic manga, mediocre on fantasy-heavy manga! 
            - Will improve the model, try a heavier model as well with more data.
    - Some pre trained networks (Resnet/VGG/Yolo etc...)
        - Notatie data: <class> <x> <y> <w> <h>
        - Filters: (5 + <class count>) * 3
    - HOG
    - Deformable Parts model.
    - ACFD: Asymmetric Cartoon Face Detector

- What are the different possibilities for facial recognition on manga?
    - VGG16 
    - VGGFace
    - Resnet50 
    - Senet50
    - Facenet
    - DeepFace ? 
    - OpenFace
    

- How do the different ways of detecting faces compare?
    - Make a visual way, like a graph to represent this.
        - Compare the results as well   
            - So far i've done: 
                - AnimeFaceXML 
                - CNN 
                - YOLO 

- Is there a difference between detecting a realistic- or a fantasy oriented face?
    - So far it definitely looks like it. A fantasy oriented face can have much more variation than a realistic looking one, so it's definitely much tougher to predict or even see. Next to that, an already fantasy-heavy looking face can have a quirky impression, making it near impossible to see for smaller models.
    - Realistic looking faces are definitely easier to detect! 
        - Tho this doesn't mean that fantasy looking faces are thrown out of the window, sometimes even Legoshi from popular manga "Beastars" (A live wolf) gets recognised as character. The model probably needs more data or a deeper structure to recognise this more easily though.

- Is there a difference in model performance between the different manga genres or authors.
    - Authors not so much, the key features of a face stay the same (especially eyes, hair, nose, shape), but fantasy-heavy authors will be more difficult to predict, definitely.
    - I wouldn't say genres matter as much, though there's no doubt that realistic genres such as Slice of life or drama will be easier to detect over fantasy (especially since fantasy pages can be a lot busier or obstructive of the faces.)
