Personal notes while i'm working on this thesis.
This will kinda contain some on the fly notes to get me started quickly.

I will be doing a research to see how facial recognition can be applied on manga, for future deepfake/manga generation. 


- Can one facial recognition model work on all manga?
    - I would like to test on a couple of different manga 
        - One piece 
            - Heavy fantasy, very unique and 'quirky' drawing style
            - Has sharks etc... with faces.
        - Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso 
            - More realistic looking drawing style. 
        - Horimiya
            - Hyper realistic. Practically real.

- What are the different possibilities for facial detection on manga?
    - The AnimeFaceXML
    - CNN
    - Some pre trained networks (Resnet/VGG etc...)
    - Deformable Parts model.
    - ACFD: Asymmetric Cartoon Face Detector


- How do the different ways of detecting faces compare?
    - Make a visual way, like a graph to represent this.



- Is there a difference between detecting a realistic- or a fantasy oriented face?




- Is there a difference in model performance between the different manga genres or authors.
