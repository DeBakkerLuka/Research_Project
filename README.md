# Research_Project
As a senior AI student for the bachelor's degree [Multimedia & Creative technologies](https://mct.be/) there is a mandatory research project. For this project you put in a dedicated amount of hours into researching a specific problem or topic in the IT world. This github page will be my documentation of this research project.

# Context
The topic I chose to research was `How can facial recognition be applied on manga?`

Before I get into what my research project contains, I should first explain what manga is. Manga, or Japanese comics is a form of graphic heavy literature. It is very comparable to western stylized comics or strip books, with speech ballons, drawings, etc... Manga continues to be an extremely popular medium in Japan, being read by millions of people worldwide. Just like most other literature media, it contains a wide array of Authors, Artists and genres. Even containing genres which are aimed at specific age groups. 

My inspiration for this research project was a small news article on the Nvidia developer website named [AI Helps Create New Manga Reflecting Osamu Tezukaâ€™s Legendary Works](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/osamu-tezuka-ai-supporterd-manga/) (A very interesting article might you be interested.) And it got me thinking about  the concept of applying AI on Black and white imagery. Could a facial detection model detect all the manga faces? What if they're very quirky? How about realistic? Would one model work for all manga, regardless of shape and form? And those are the questions that I will try to solve in this project.
